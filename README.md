The present study examines a system of collecting solar energy indoors, aiming at managing and converting the energy into forms that meet energy needs to achieve the autonomy of the system. In the context of the current reality, addressing the challenges of climate change emerges as a priority, using innovative solutions that harness renewable energy sources and adopt electronic circuits as the core of technology. The introduction of the term "harvesting" in the field of renewable energy sources is crucial for the efficient use of natural resources, encouraging a departure from traditional methods of energy production. The analysis focuses on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that utilize the technique of solar harvesting, highlighting them as a pioneering solution for energy provision. The integration of photovoltaic circuits allows WSN to collect and store energy from solar illumination, providing autonomy and sustainability. The study progresses to analyze the advantages of solar harvesting in WSN, emphasizing autonomous operation and environmental friendliness. Subsequently, the importance of photovoltaic systems is highlighted, along with the application of the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method. It explains how photovoltaic systems are a fundamental means of converting solar radiation into electrical energy and how MPPT technology is required for the effective use of the generated energy. Finally, the developed solar energy harvesting system is presented, using the integrated bq25505. The construction is tailored to the applicationâ€™s needs, efficiently managing the collected energy and demonstrating remarkable results under various lighting conditions. This study provides significant information for the design and development of light-sensitive energy harvesting systems, with multiple practical applications in professional and residential spaces. Keywords: Solar Harvesting, Energy Management, Renewable Energy Sources, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Photovoltaic Systems, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), Integrated bq25505.
